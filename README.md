# TreeList
TreeList is a simple generic tree data type with editor support for your Unity projects. It's based on a List<> so its name. 
## Features:
- Fast serialization/deserialization (only data and depth of the tree node)
- Fast iteration, children enumeration (because of the List)
- Not so fast modification (because of the List)
- UIToolkit and IMGUI editors (mostly equivalent in functionality)
